Hey guys, this time I tried smuggling in Elite: Dangerous (Beta) by Frontier Development and well. it didn't go too well. In the end I attack civilian freighters and finally find "valuable" goods to smuggle. Hope you enjoy it, even though I'm not yet quite good commentating it. Find it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCUc6SO3GZo Playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN1yhsZCLKqN9LqNeXWvuQjVjR7fGLDoI Thank you for watching and enjoy. Link to article ( Although this is not Star Citizen, I do believe this is the first space dogfighting experience to get Rift support. It sounds like it makes a huge difference for immersion, and I can't wait to have that experience with the level of fidelity that Star Citizen will offer! Edit: added. So Frontier Developments just brought nice holiday present for alpha testers, brining real Oculus Rift, Track IR and 3D TV support, sans lot of bug fixes and performance improvements, ending with feedback induced changes. Limited changelog can be found here Also RPS playing ED with OR here http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/12/20/elite-dangerous-oculus-rift/. ~~I'm on the website, whenever I click "CLAIM A KEY FOR ELITE DANGEROUS (OCULUS RIFT)" The page refreshes and doesn't give me a key. Any ideas?~~ You must click Elite Dangerous for Steam first, once you see the key, then you claim the key for Oculus. 
###Build Help/Ready: Have you read the sidebar and rules ( (Please do) Yup. What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better. High Quality gaming, Oculus CV1 (possibly CV2) support, room to upgrade. If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings) 1080p ultra quality on most AAA titles, specifically buttery-smooth max detail on Elite Dangerous Oculus Rift. How are you supposed to click on things to select them? The cursor doesn't seem to take into account where my head is in figuring out which system I'm clicking on. The best "luck" I've had is holding my head perfectly still and facing directly forward while hitting the Rift reset button so my virtual head goes to the default position. Then the mouse almost kinda sorta lines up. Additionally the "name tags" for the system are billboard orienting towards the floating Hi, i ask myself the question mainly because of the LCD screen Rift S that we will have contrasts and blacks much worse than an OLED screen . This is one of the games that I really  So among other complaints, such as small blurry spots in my vision on both eyes, I have some issues in particular with Elite Dangerous. With ED: 1. There are these weird geometric outlines that seem to center on the windows in my ship. They are only noticeable when in space and looking out the windows. Doesn't matter which ship. It is very hard to describe, so I took some pictures. What I'm seeing is almost like some kind of grey film on the windows around the edges with weird. Forgive the repetition, research tells me this has been discussed before but I'm going to reframe the discussion a bit. I've been gradually shelling out a small accumulated fortune to build on my Spectre x360 to the point where I can run ED with a Rift. Thing is, being a total gaming noob I really like the rift controllers. I like how tactile they are, being able to move my hands about when dogfighting and also I can't really justify the additional outlay for a hotas this early on in my noobnes. Hey folks, So I am having issues with getting my ship view straight. I have the keys all bound so I look straight and when I reset my view, the ship is slightly tilted to the right and if I turn my head left a little and reset the view, the ship is straight on. Both my sensors are pointed right at my head and I keep playing around and resetting them but was wondering if Im doing somethign wrong? Thanks.
